        <h3>Design Principles</h3>
        <p>The <span>SOLID</span> acronym: Single Responsibility, Open-Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, and Dependency Inversion.</p>
        <h3>Should think</h3>
        <p>What are your classes? How many should you have? What behavior will they implement? How much do they know about other classes? How much of themselves should they expose?</p>
        <h3>Extract Extra Responsibilities from Methods</h3>

<pre>
def diameters
  wheels.collect {|wheel|
  wheel.rim + (wheel.tire * 2)}
end
</pre>

        <p>This method clearly has two responsibilities: it iterates over the wheels and it calculates the diameter of each wheel.</p>

<pre>
# first - iterate over the array
def diameters
  wheels.collect {|wheel| diameter(wheel)}
end
# second - calculate diameter of ONE wheel
def diameter(wheel)
  wheel.rim + (wheel.tire * 2))
end
</pre>

        <h3>Establish independent class</h3>
<pre>
class Gear
  attr_reader :chainring, :cog, :wheel
  def initialize(chainring, cog, rim, tire)
    @chainring = chainring
    @cog = cog
    @wheel = Wheel.new(rim, tire)
  end
  def ratio
    chainring / cog.to_f
  end
  def gear_inches
    ratio * wheel.diameter
  end
  Wheel = Struct.new(:rim, :tire) do
    def diameter
      rim + (tire * 2)
    end
  end
end
</pre>

<p> now your application has an explicit need for a Wheel class that it can use independently of Gear.  It’s time to set Wheel free to be a separate class of it’s own.  Because you have already carefully isolated the Wheel behavior inside of the Gear class, this change is painless. Simply convert the Wheel Struct to an independent Wheel class and add the new circumference method.</p> 

<pre>
class Gear
  attr_reader :chainring, :cog, :wheel
  def initialize(chainring, cog, wheel=nil)
    @chainring = chainring
    @cog = cog
    @wheel = wheel
  end
  def ratio
    chainring / cog.to_f
  end
  def gear_inches
    ratio * wheel.diameter
  end
end

class Wheel
  attr_reader :rim, :tire
  def initialize(rim, tire)
    @rim = rim
    @tire = tire
  end
  def diameter
    rim + (tire * 2)
  end
  def circumference
    diameter * Math::PI
  end
end

@wheel = Wheel.new(26, 1.5)
puts @wheel.circumference
# -> 91.106186954104
puts Gear.new(52, 11, @wheel).gear_inches
# -> 137.090909090909
puts Gear.new(52, 11).ratio
# -> 4.72727272727273
</pre>

        <h3>Managing Dependencies</h3>
<pre>
class Gear
  attr_reader :chainring, :cog, :rim, :tire
  def initialize(chainring, cog, rim, tire)
    @chainring = chainring
    @cog = cog
    @rim = rim
    @tire = tire
  end
  def gear_inches
    ratio * Wheel.new(rim, tire).diameter
  end
  def ratio
    chainring / cog.to_f
  end
  # ...
end

class Wheel
  attr_reader :rim, :tire
  def initialize(rim, tire)
    @rim = rim
    @tire = tire
  end
  def diameter
    rim + (tire * 2)
  end
  # ...
end
Gear.new(52, 11, 26, 1.5).gear_inches
</pre>
        <p>Recognizing Dependencies An object has a dependency when it knows: </p>
        <p>• The name of another class. Gear expects a class named Wheel to exist.</p>
        <p>• The name of a message that it intends to send to someone other than self. Gear expects a Wheel instance to respond to diameter.</p>
        <p>• The arguments that a message requires. Gear knows that Wheel.new requires a rim and a tire.</p>
        <p>• The order of those arguments. Gear knows the first argument to Wheel.new should be rim, the second, tire.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Each of these dependencies creates a chance that Gear will be forced to change because of a change to Wheel.</p>

<pre>
class Gear
  attr_reader :chainring, :cog, :rim, :tire
  def initialize(chainring, cog, rim, tire)
    @chainring = chainring
    @cog = cog
    @rim = rim
    @tire = tire
  end
  def gear_inches
    ratio * Wheel.new(rim, tire).diameter
  end
  # ...
end

Gear.new(52, 11, 26, 1.5).gear_inches

class Gear
  attr_reader :chainring, :cog, :wheel
  def initialize(chainring, cog, wheel)
    @chainring = chainring
    @cog = cog
    @wheel = wheel
  end
  def gear_inches
    ratio * wheel.diameter
  end
  # ...
end
# Gear expects a 'Duck' that knows 'diameter'
Gear.new(52, 11, Wheel.new(26, 1.5)).gear_inches
</pre>
        <p>This technique is known as <span>dependency injection</span>. Gear is now smarter because it <span>knows less.</span></p>

</pre>

        <h3>Remove Argument-Order Dependencies</h3> 
        <p>Use Hashes for Initialization Arguments</p> 

<pre>
class Gear
  attr_reader :chainring, :cog, :wheel
  def initialize(args)
    @chainring = args[:chainring]
    @cog = args[:cog]
    @wheel = args[:wheel]
  end
  ...
end

Gear.new(
:chainring => 52,
:cog => 11,
:wheel => Wheel.new(26, 1.5)).gear_inches
</pre>

        <p>The first and most obvious is that it removes every dependency on argument order. Gear is now free to add or remove initialization arguments and defaults, secure in the knowledge that no change will have side effects in other code.</p> 
        <h3>Explicitly Define Defaults</h3> 

<pre>
# specifying defaults using ||
def initialize(args)
  @chainring = args[:chainring] || 40
  @cog = args[:cog] || 18
  @wheel = args[:wheel]
end
</pre>

        <p>In the case where args contains a :boolean_thing key that defaults to true, use of || in this way makes it impossible for the caller to ever explicitly set the final variable to false or nil.</p> 
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The fetch method expects the key you’re fetching to be in the hash and supplies several options for explicitly handling missing keys. Its advantage over || is that it does not automatically return nil when it fails to find your key.</p>

<pre>
# specifying defaults using fetch
def initialize(args)
  @chainring = args.fetch(:chainring, 40)
  @cog = args.fetch(:cog, 18)
  @wheel = args[:wheel]
end
</pre>

<p>merge has the same effect as fetch; the defaults will get merged only if their keys are not in the hash.</p>

<pre>
# specifying defaults by merging a defaults hash
def initialize(args)
  args = defaults.merge(args)
  @chainring = args[:chainring]
  #
  ...
end
def defaults
  {:chainring => 40, :cog => 18}
end
</pre>

<h3>Isolate Multiparameter Initialization</h3>

<pre>
# When Gear is part of an external interface
module SomeFramework
  class Gear
    attr_reader :chainring, :cog, :wheel
    def initialize(chainring, cog, wheel)
      @chainring = chainring
      @cog = cog
      @wheel = wheel
    end
    # ...
  end
end

# wrap the interface to protect yourself from changes
module GearWrapper
  def self.gear(args)
    SomeFramework::Gear.new(args[:chainring],
      args[:cog],
      args[:wheel])
  end
end

# Now you can create a new Gear using an arguments hash.
GearWrapper.gear(
  :chainring => 52,
  :cog => 11,
  :wheel => Wheel.new(26, 1.5)).gear_inches
</pre>

<p>The above technique for substituting an options hash for a list of fixed-order arguments is perfect for cases where you are forced to depend on external interfaces that you cannot change. Do not allow these kinds of external dependencies to permeate your code; protect yourself by wrapping each in a method that is owned by your own application.</p>
<h3>Choosing Dependency Direction</h3>
<p>The choices you make about the direction of dependencies have far reaching consequences that manifest themselves for the life of your application. If you get this right, your application will be pleasant to work on and easy to maintain. If you get it wrong then the dependencies will gradually take over and the application will become harder and harder to change.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> This short statement belies the sophistication of the idea, which is based on three simple truths about code:</p>
<p>• Some classes are more likely than others to have changes in requirements.</p>
<p>• Concrete classes are more likely to change than abstract classes.</p>
<p>• Changing a class that has many dependents will result in widespread consequences.</p>

<p>Depending on an abstraction is always safer than depending on a
concretion because by its very nature, the abstraction is more stable.The key to managing dependencies is to control their direction.

# Trip preparation becomes more complicated
class Trip
  attr_reader :bicycles, :customers, :vehicle
  def prepare(preparers)
    preparers.each {|preparer|
      case preparer
      when Mechanic
        preparer.prepare_bicycles(bicycles)
      when TripCoordinator
        preparer.buy_food(customers)
      when Driver
        preparer.gas_up(vehicle)
        preparer.fill_water_tank(vehicle)
      end
    }
  end
end

# when you introduce TripCoordinator and Driver
class TripCoordinator
  def buy_food(customers)
    # ...
  end
end
class Driver
  def gas_up(vehicle)
    #...
  end
  def fill_water_tank(vehicle)
    #...
  end
end
</pre>

<p>
Avoid getting sidetracked by your knowledge of what each argument’s class already does; think instead about what prepare needs. Considered from prepare’ s point of view, the problem is straightforward. The prepare method wants to prepare the trip. Its arguments arrive ready to collaborate in trip preparation. The design would be simpler if prepare just trusted them to do so.</p>

<pre>
# Trip preparation becomes easier
class Trip
  attr_reader :bicycles, :customers, :vehicle
  def prepare(preparers)
    preparers.each {|preparer|
    preparer.prepare_trip(self)}
  end
end

# when every preparer is a Duck
# that responds to 'prepare_trip'
class Mechanic
  def prepare_trip(trip)
    trip.bicycles.each {|bicycle|
      prepare_bicycle(bicycle)}
  end
  # ...
end

class TripCoordinator
  def prepare_trip(trip)
    buy_food(trip.customers)
  end
  # ...
end

class Driver
  def prepare_trip(trip)
    vehicle = trip.vehicle
    gas_up(vehicle)
    fill_water_tank(vehicle)
  end
  # ...
end
</pre>

<p>MountainBike and RoadBike take advantage of only one of these opportunities for specialization. Both implement default_tire_size, but neither implements default_chain. Each subclass thus supplies its own default for tire size but inherits the common default for chain.</p>

<pre>
class Bicycle
  attr_reader :size, :chain, :tire_size
  def initialize(args={})
    @size = args[:size]
    @chain = args[:chain] || default_chain
    @tire_size = args[:tire_size] || default_tire_size
  end
  def default_chain
    '10-speed'
  end
end

class RoadBike < Bicycle
  # ...
  def default_tire_size
    '23'
  end
end

# <- subclass default
class MountainBike < Bicycle
  # ...
  def default_tire_size # <- subclass default
    '2.1'
  end
end
</pre>

<h3>Decoupling Subclasses Using Hook Messages</h3>
<pre>
class Bicycle
  attr_reader :size, :chain, :tire_size
  def initialize(args={})
    @size = args[:size]
    @chain = args[:chain] || default_chain
    @tire_size = args[:tire_size] || default_tire_size
  end
  def spares
    { tire_size: tire_size,
          chain: chain}
  end
  def default_chain
  '10-speed'
  end
  def default_tire_size
    raise NotImplementedError
  end
end
class RoadBike < Bicycle
  attr_reader :tape_color
  def initialize(args)
    @tape_color = args[:tape_color]
    super(args)
  end
  def spares
    super.merge({ tape_color: tape_color})
  end
  def default_tire_size
    '23'
  end
end

class Bicycle
  def initialize(args={})
    @size = args[:size]
    @chain = args[:chain] || default_chain
    @tire_size = args[:tire_size] || default_tire_size
    post_initialize(args)
  end
  # Bicycle both sends
  def post_initialize(args) # and implements this
    nil
  end
  # ...
end
class RoadBike < Bicycle
  def post_initialize(args)
    # RoadBike can
    @tape_color = args[:tape_color] # optionally
  end
  # override it
  # ...
end
</pre>

<p> This change doesn’t just remove the send of super from RoadBike’ s initialize method, it removes the initialize method altogether. RoadBike no longer controls initialization; it instead contributes specializations to a larger, abstract algorithm. That algorithm is defined in the abstract superclass Bicycle, which in turn is responsible for sending post_initialize.  RoadBike is still responsible for what initialization it needs but is no longer responsible for when its initialization occurs. This change allows RoadBike to know less about Bicycle, reducing the coupling between them and making each more flexible in the face of an uncertain future. RoadBike doesn’t know when its post_initialize method will be called and it doesn’t care what object actually sends the message.  Bicycle (or any other object) could send this message at any time, there is no requirement that it be sent during object initialization. </p>

<pre>
class Bicycle
  # ...
  def spares
    { tire_size: tire_size,
          chain: chain}.merge(local_spares)
  end
  # hook for subclasses to override
  def local_spares
    {}
  end
  end
class RoadBike < Bicycle
  # ...
  def local_spares
    {tape_color: tape_color}
  end
end
</pre>

<p>
This change preserves the specialization supplied by RoadBike but reduces its coupling to Bicycle. RoadBike no longer has to know that Bicycle implements a spares method </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
When objects that play a common role need to share behavior, they do so via a Ruby module. The code defined in a module can be added to any object, be it an instance of a class, a class itself, or another module.  </p>

<pre>
module Schedulable
  attr_writer :schedule

  def schedule
    @schedule ||= ::Schedule.new
  end
  def schedulable?(start_date, end_date)
    !scheduled?(start_date - lead_days, end_date)
  end
  def scheduled?(start_date, end_date)
    schedule.scheduled?(self, start_date, end_date)
  end
  # includers may override
  def lead_days
    0
  end
end

class Bicycle
  include Schedulable

  def lead_days
    1
  end
  # ...
end

require 'date'
starting = Date.parse("2015/09/04")
ending = Date.parse("2015/09/10")
b = Bicycle.new
b.schedulable?(starting, ending)
# This Bicycle is not scheduled
# between 2015-09-03 and 2015-09-10
# => true
